# BSP on Epiphany

The [Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel)
computing model is a model for designing parallel algorithms.  This library (EBSP) provides an 
implementation of the model on top of the Epiphany SDK (ESDK).  This allows the BSP computing model
to be used with the Epiphany architecture developed by [Adapteva](http://www.adapteva.com).
In particular this library has been implemented and tested on the  [Parallella](http://www.parallella.org) board.
